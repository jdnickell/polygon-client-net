# polygon-client-net
An unofficial and incomplete .net client library for the Polygon.io REST and WebSocket API.
At the moment, I'm just adding things to this public repo as needed for functionality in another project.


## REST API spec
The rest.json file captures the [Polygon.io api spec](https://api.polygon.io/openapi) at the time of initially developing this library. If it doesn't match, then this library is out of date.

## TODO
 - Document example of a one-off deserialized response (Agg.cs) vs a generic snake_case to PascalCase deserializer

## Versioning
This library's versioning guidelines follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/).
